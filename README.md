## CIFAR-Image-Classification
Here can be found the Jupyter Notebook of a CNN implementation to classify CIFAR data. 
This project was made to learn the basics of TensorFlow and Kerras.

This implementation consists of using a 6-layer convolutional base to the network (Conv2D and MaxPooling2D), flattening the output and then setting two dense layers on top of it to complete the model. Note that this is not an optimal model and yet yields a performance of 70% accuracy.
